    <h2>Welcome to the Tiger Program Readiness Questionnaire</h2>
    <p>Karate Atlanta‚Äôs Tiger Program is the result of over 25 years of working with young students and families. It was created specifically for children ages 4 to 6 and is backed by the experience of the American Taekwondo Association, founded in 1969.</p>
    <p>Our goal isn‚Äôt just to teach kicks and punches ‚Äî it‚Äôs to help your child build the focus, confidence, respect, coordination, and classroom habits they‚Äôll need for school and life.</p>
    <p><strong>Is your child currently attending preschool or kindergarten?</strong></p>

  </div>

  <div id="q2" class="question">
    <p>Do they easily follow directions, wait their turn, and raise their hand before speaking ‚Äî or do they still need help with those classroom habits?</p>
    <button onclick="goTo('q3')">They do those things easily</button>
    <button onclick="goTo('q7')">They still need help</button>
    <button class="back" onclick="goBack('q1')">Back</button>

  <div id="q4" class="question">
    <p>Rec sports are often short-term and parent-led. Karate Atlanta‚Äôs Tiger Program is different ‚Äî it uses professional instructors, structured lessons, and life-skill training through martial arts.</p>

    <button onclick="goTo('trial')">No, just trying something fun for now</button>

  </div>

  <div id="q7" class="question">
    <p>Karate Atlanta understands that young children develop at different speeds. Our structured program helps reinforce listening, respect, and coordination through repetition and fun.</p>

    <button onclick="goTo('q3')">We want help building those skills</button>

    <button onclick="goTo('q7')">They still need help</button>
    <button class="back" onclick="goBack('q1')">Back</button>
