  <h2>Welcome to the Tiger Program Readiness Questionnaire</h2>
  <p>Karate Atlanta‚Äôs Tiger Program is the result of over 25 years of working with young students and families. It was created specifically for children ages 4 to 6 and is backed by the experience of the American Taekwondo Association, founded in 1969.</p>
  <p>Our goal isn‚Äôt just to teach kicks and punches ‚Äî it‚Äôs to help your child build the focus, confidence, respect, coordination, and classroom habits they‚Äôll need for school and life.</p>
  <p><strong>Is your child currently attending preschool or kindergarten?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q2')">Yes</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q8')">No</button>
</div>

<!-- Q2 -->
<div id="q2" class="question">
  <p>Since your child is already in an organized school structure, they should be familiar with taking directions, following the instructor, waiting in line, and raising their hand before talking.</p>
  <p><strong>Do you feel your child does these tasks easily, or needs more help and reinforcement with that level of classroom skills?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q3')">They do those things easily</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q7')">They still need help</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q1')">Back</button>
</div>

<!-- Q8 (from Q1 = No) -->
<div id="q8" class="question">
  <p><strong>Since your child hasn‚Äôt started school yet, how well do they follow directions in group settings like birthday parties or playdates?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q3')">They do well</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q7')">Still learning</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q1')">Back</button>
</div>

<!-- Q3 -->
<div id="q3" class="question">
  <p><strong>Has your child ever participated in recreational activities like soccer, gymnastics, dance, or swim?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q4')">Yes</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q5')">No, this would be their first activity</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q2')">Back</button>
</div>

<!-- Q4 -->
<div id="q4" class="question">
  <p>Many recreational sports are typically 1 day a week and casually coached by parent volunteers. Our program is taught by full-time professionals and is designed to develop physical and mental skills through repetition and structure.</p>
  <p><strong>Does that sound like something you‚Äôre looking for, or are you just exploring something fun for now?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q6')">Looking for structure and development</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('trial')">Just something fun</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q3')">Back</button>
</div>

<!-- Q5 -->
<div id="q5" class="question">
  <p>Just like with school or reading, physical and mental habits take time to develop. Our Tiger Program helps young students with things like left/right recognition, balance, focus, and how to respond to strangers and bullies ‚Äî but it does take consistency.</p>
  <p><strong>Are you ready to begin helping them build habits like focus and balance?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q6')">Yes</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('trial')">Not sure yet</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q3')">Back</button>

<!-- Q6 -->
<div id="q6" class="question">
  <p>Karate Atlanta has been in business for over 25 years and belongs to the American Taekwondo Association, which was founded in 1969. We've used all these years of experience to develop this questionnaire ‚Äî with a little help from AI (hey, it‚Äôs 2025!).</p>
  <p><strong>Today, we believe your child is ready to enroll in the Tiger Program ‚Äî our structured 6-month membership for ages 4‚Äì6.</strong></p>
  <p>Would you like to speak with an instructor about the Tiger Program and savings for enrolling today, or would you still prefer to start with our 5-class trial?</p>

  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q5')">Back</button>
</div>

<!-- Q7 (needs more help) -->
<div id="q7" class="question">
  <p>At the younger ages we‚Äôve noticed students all develop at different times. Just like school, Karate Atlanta is based off of structure and discipline ‚Äî while also creating a love of martial arts through fun and exciting classes.</p>
  <p>In order to better develop those skills in following directions, it will take time and isn‚Äôt something that happens overnight.</p>
  <p><strong>Are you looking for an organization that will reinforce these life skills and help prepare your child for school ‚Äî or just something more recreational?</strong></p>
