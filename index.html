  <h2>Welcome to the Tiger Program Readiness Questionnaire</h2>
  <p>Karate Atlanta’s Tiger Program is the result of over 25 years of working with young students and families. It was created specifically for children ages 4 to 6 and is backed by the experience of the American Taekwondo Association, founded in 1969.</p>
  <p>Our goal isn’t just to teach kicks and punches — it’s to help your child build the focus, confidence, respect, coordination, and classroom habits they’ll need for school and life.</p>
  <p><strong>Is your child currently attending preschool or kindergarten?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q2')">Yes</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q8')">No</button>
</div>

<div id="q2" class="question">
  <p>Since your child is already in an organized school structure, they may already be used to taking directions, waiting in line, and raising their hand before speaking.</p>
  <p><strong>Do you feel your child does these things easily, or would benefit from more help and reinforcement?</strong></p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q3')">They do those things easily</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q7')">They still need help</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q1')">Back</button>
</div>

<div id="q8" class="question">
  <p><strong>Every child develops at their own pace.</strong> Since your child hasn’t started preschool yet, how would you describe their ability to follow directions, wait their turn, and focus during group activities?</p>
  <button onclick="goTo('q3')">They do well</button>
  <button onclick="goTo('q7')">Still learning</button>
  <button class="back" onclick="goTo('q1')">Back</button>
